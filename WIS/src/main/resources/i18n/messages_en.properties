faq.FirstQ=Does placing a suggestion costs something?
faq.Title=Frequently Asked Questions
faq.FirstA=Of course not! Suggestions can improve your work as well as our work so we are happy to read what you would like to improve.
faq.SecondQ=If I post a bad suggestion, will I suffer any consequences?
faq.SecondA=Of course not. Although we would like all suggestions to be correct, our system is not perfect. If you make a mistake you can always delete your suggestion until it has entered the "In Progress" state. However, when this happens, you can always write to us. We will try to help :).
faq.ThirdQ=How do you calculate points for employees?
faq.ThirdA=The algorithm is our sweet secret. We can not disclose it. Points are calculated fairly, no matter what position you occupy in our company.
faq.FourthQ=What can I spend points on?
faq.FourthA=The employee can not directly allocate points to anything. Points are counted by the HR department when calculating the place in the queue. In the future, we plan to expand our possibilities with a benefit plan.
