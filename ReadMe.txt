This system is for postgraduate studies school project. Be patient, it's just a start. :)
It requires DBMS - Connection Pools are for Derby/Postgress but it will work with any. (as it is now, later only with ones, that allows integer[] type)

What work:
- adding, listing, sorting suggestions
- navigation
- communication with DB Postgres/Derby
- accounts listing
- login system - partially

What does not work:
-Everything else :)
-Ranking system to check if 1 user can vote 1 time
-Exceptions
-Junit Test
-Validation of forms
